# Game_of_Life.py
This is a simple project called game of life. Works with cells that are born and die depending on game rules.  
At each moment, the map changes its state according to the cells that live and die

# Rules
1 - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.  
2 - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.  
3 - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.  
4 - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
